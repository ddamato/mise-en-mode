# [Mise en mode](mode.place)

This is the home of the resource repository dedicated to mise em mode; a design methodology that considers an experience to be a nested collection of modes where any one of them can be expressively enhanced. First presented at [Clarity 2023](https://www.clarityconf.com/event/2023) by [Donnie D'Amato](https://donnie.damato.design/).

Feedback and discussions about the approach are welcome in the [issues](https://github.com/ddamato/mise-en-mode/issues).
