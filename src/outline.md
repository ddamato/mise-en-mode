- Rectangles are important
    - Schema, Lauren LoPrete
    - Rectangles IRL
    - The missing link (with semantic tokens)
    - How we might execute design decisions not through complex token naming but using the boundaries of rectangles.
- Design with intentions
    - What does "semantic" mean?
    - The "smedium" test
    - Examples of semantic
    - Why is semantic naming so important?
        - Dark mode
        - Private labeling
- Ondark Virus
    - Wrote this is frustration about the token explosion that comes with adding "ondark" tokens.
    - Example of the problem.
        - Footer CTA, inverted area
        - Add more components, requires more "ondark" tokens
        - Eventually you have 2x times the tokens
    - Solution: use the same tokens with different values
        - Scope the values to the area, name this with purpose. Why are you making this change?
    - Light and dark are NOT semantic. Is this treatment a callout, campaign, low-power, high-contrast? Why is it different?
- Complementary Space
    - Wrote this as an exploration about what a truly semantic spacing system might look like.
    - Example of the problem.
    - Describe space in terms of relationships not amounts.
    - "How closely related is this thing related to other things?"
    - Group apples and oranges.
    - Change the frame (rectangle) of reference in the same environment. Shrinking test. Update the ruler at every rectangle.
    - If you want have more space, zoom out your frame of reference. If you want less, zoom in.
    - Nathan Curtis recommends less spacing options, Hicks Law.
- Mise en mode
    - The previous ideas are very similar; creating a boundary which has new qualities for the elements inside.
    - This region is different because:
        - There's critical information that the user needs to see.
        - There's a lot of information that we need the user to review.
        - This is a different kind of task.
        - This is a promotion.
        - NOT. I think it looks _cooler_.
    - Art history, mise en abyme
    - What is a "mode"?
        - Caps Lock, settings produce different results
        - A theme with a purpose; a semantic theme.
        - The mode affects appearance for a purpose.
        - Layout vs. Content vs. Appearance
        - Wireframe is MODELESS
        - Encoding hierarchy (heading/paragraph, primary/secondary) into layout...
        - "There is no critical button, only a button that exists in a critical mode."
    - Difference between critical button and critical mode
    - Designing with meaningful rectangles
        - 
        - Consider designing by identifying areas of intentful boundaries; like wireframing.
